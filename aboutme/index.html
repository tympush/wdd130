    <h2>Tymur Pushnoy</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Tymur Pushnoy.</p>
    <p>I'm originally from Ukraine, but I later moved to Belgium. And then to England. And then briefly to Poland. And then I moved back to Belgium where I am now. 
    I Speak English, Dutch/Flemish and Russian. I also learned French for about 8 years, but in all honesy, I wouldn't exactly say I can speak French.</p>
    <p>I'm not a very active, sporty person, and love about anything that's more creatively minded. 
    I love Programming, Video Games, Games Design, 3D Modelling, Video Editing, Movies, Shows, Books, Writing, just fiction in general, Music, Animation, and so on...</p>
    <p>As you can imagine, with so much moving between countries, my education has become a bit of a mess. And BYU Pathway has allowed me to sort it out and continue my education. 
    I'm aiming for a Bachelor's degree in software development, simply because programming and other computer work is what I love.</p>
